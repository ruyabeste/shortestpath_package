ðŸ“„ Project Purpose
This project was developed as part of a university assignment to create a complete Python package from scratch and document it using Sphinx. The main goal is to:

Write a functional Python module

Structure it as an installable package

Document the code with proper docstrings

Generate HTML documentation with Sphinx

Create unit tests using pytest

Package and upload the project to TestPyPI

Practice version control and automation via GitHub and GitHub Actions

The core function of this package computes the shortest distance between two geographic coordinates using the Haversine formula. The project demonstrates not only how to implement such a function, but also how to prepare it for professional-level distribution and documentation.
